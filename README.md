## Getting and Cleaning Data Project

Author: Pablo Doval (pablo.doval@gmail.com)


### Overview
This project is an excersise on data retrieval and cleaning, developed as an assignment for John Hopkins' Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera. The project's focus is not in the analysis of the data, but just on the steps to turn the source data on something usable for further analysis processes.

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

### Code Book
There is an associated code book where detailed information about all variables, as well as the processes that were followed to turn the original data into a clean and tidy data set, can be found. This code book is in the CodeBook.md file.
